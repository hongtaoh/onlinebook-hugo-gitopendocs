OpenGitDocs builds a static site that you can host anywhere, including [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/), or [Bitbucket Cloud](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html).

You can even take advantage of continuous integration using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html)!

Visit the main site for full instructions on [hosting your OpenGitDocs site in your repository](https://opengitdocs.com/host/).
