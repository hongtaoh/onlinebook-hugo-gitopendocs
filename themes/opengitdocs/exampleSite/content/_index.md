## Use Your Existing Repository

You can use OpenGitDocs with your current repository and keep your code and documentation all in one place. OpenGitDocs works with static sites hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/), or [Bitbucket Cloud](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html).

## Automated Continuous Delivery

A seamless site-generation experience makes it easy to automate your documentation site updates with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html).
